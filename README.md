CodeChef Difficulty 1077 Problem

Digit Sum Parities
For a positive integer 
M
M, MoEngage defines 
digitSum(M)
digitSum(M) as the sum of digits of the number 
M
M (when written in decimal).

For example, 
digitSum(1023)
=
1
+
0
+
2
+
3
=
6
digitSum(1023)=1+0+2+3=6.

Given a positive integer 
N
N, find the smallest integer 
X
X strictly greater than 
N
N such that:

digitSum(N)
digitSum(N) and 
digitSum(X)
digitSum(X) have different parity, i.e. one of them is odd and the other is even.
Input Format
The first line contains an integer 
T
T, the number of test cases. The description of the 
T
T test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line of input with a single integer, the number 
N
N.
Output Format
For each test case, print in a single line, an integer, the answer to the problem.
